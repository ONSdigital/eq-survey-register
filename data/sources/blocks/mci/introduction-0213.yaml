description: <p>The information supplied is used to produce monthly estimates of the
  total retail sales in Great Britain where retailing is defined as the sale of goods
  to the general public for household consumption. The Retail Sales Index is a key
  indicator of the progress of the economy. It is also used to help estimate consumer
  spending on retail goods and the output of the retail sector, both of which feed
  into the compilation of the National Accounts. The results are also used by the
  Bank of England and HM Treasury to inform decision making by government and in formulating
  financial policies. The results <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry">are
  published on our website</a>.</p>
